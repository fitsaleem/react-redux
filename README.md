# redux is used for state management
# we can access or chnage state from anyware


# Let's now discuss some of the key concepts and functions in Redux Toolkit:

**store:**

The Redux store is a single centralized place that manages the state of your entire application. All components in your application can access this store and update or retrieve data from it as needed.

**Reducer:**

 A reducer is a function that determines changes to an application's state. It takes the current state and an action, then returns a new state.

 **useSelector:**

 This is a hook that allows you to extract data from the Redux store state, using a selector function. It's used to access the specific state values needed by your component.

 **useDispatch:**

 This is a hook that returns a reference to the dispatch function from the Redux store. You use it to dispatch actions that modify the state in the Redux store.

 **createSlice:**

 This function lets you generate a slice of the Redux store, which includes the reducer and actions. This reduces boilerplate code by allowing the creation of a single file known as "slice" that combines actions and reducers.

    Using Redux Toolkit allows you to write simpler code, speeds up development, and makes your Redux applications easier to maintain.
